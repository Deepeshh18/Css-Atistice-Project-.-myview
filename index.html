                <p class="center">
                    Getting outdoors is wonderful for children. They get natural sunlight, which gives them Vitamin D,
                    and they get a lot of fresh air, which allows them to get good sleep at night. The better sleep they
                    get, the healthier they are and the more their body will be able to grow. Cycling around allows for
                    them to learn the lay of the land, and be comfortable in their surroundings. This is especially good
                    should they find themselves needing you for something, as they should promptly know the quickest
                    route home by memory. Let them spend time outdoors when the weather is nice, and allow them to go
                    off on their own from time to time. Just make sure they know to check in at the right times, and
                    make sure that kids should have protective bike gear to ensure they are safe, no matter the weather.

                <p class="center">Once upon a time, there was a river that flowed through a deep forest. On one bank of
                    the river, there lived a handsome and clever deer. ... From the day crocodile saw the deer, he
                    wanted to catch him. One day when the deer was grazing near the river, he saw some bright red
                    berries on the opposite bank.</p>
